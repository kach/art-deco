    "# Art-Deco DSLs: beyond operator overloading\n",
    "\n",
    "I think one of the greatest ideas in computer science is the notion of an **\"embedded DSL\"**: the idea that programming languages come in all shapes and sizes, and that little domain-specific languages (DSLs) can fit nicely within larger general-purpose languages. For example, many popular array-programming DSLs like [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [JAX](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax) live _within_ the general-purpose language Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python in particular is a great language to build embedded DSLs in, because DSLs can use Python's elegant [_operator overloading interface_](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names) to repurpose existing Python syntax for their own specialized semantics (e.g. repurposing the `+` operator for vectorized array operations). There is a lot to like about embedding DSLs this way:\n",
    "1. Embedded DSLs inherit a lot of comforts \"for free\" from having Python as the host language (e.g. parsing, error checking, editor tooling, syntax highlighting, built-in data types, package registry, …).\n",
    "2. Embedded DSLs immediately integrate with the Python language, and even the broader module ecosystem (including other DSLs). For example, you can do a computation with NumPy or PyTorch and then plot the result with Matplotlib.\n",
    "3. Potential users often already know Python, so it is not hard to convince them to try an embedded DSL.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why _wouldn't_ you implement your next DSL by operator-overloading in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "**One fundamental limitation of operator overloading** is that it cannot help you override Python's semantics for **control flow** (e.g. the semantics of the `if` statement) or **scoping** (e.g. the semantics of variable assignment). This often leads to awkward, unergonomic designs. For example, because JAX cannot override Python's `if` or `while` statements by operator overloading, conditionals and loops are [messy](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/control-flow.html#control-flow) to work with. Similarly, a probabilistic programming language really does need traverse both branches of an `if` statement whose predicate depends on a random choice—but you cannot implement that with pure operator overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, many new DSLs over the last few years (e.g. [SEJITS](https://sejits.eecs.berkeley.edu/), [Taichi](https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi), [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/), [Exo](https://github.com/exo-lang/exo), [memo](https://github.com/kach/memo), [Dr.Jit](https://github.com/mitsuba-renderer/drjit), [Allo](https://github.com/cornell-zhang/allo), [loma](https://github.com/BachiLi/loma_public)) have taken **a clever new approach to embedding**: _parsing and transforming Python ASTs directly within Python_, using Python's built-in mechanisms for introspection. These DSLs work by providing a Python [decorator](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-decorator) that is used to mark a definition as DSL code rather than Python code. The decorators never intend to actually execute the definition they decorate. Instead, they do something sneaky: they read in the decorated definition's Python AST, and then compile that AST it _as if_ it were code in the DSL, i.e. under the DSL's artificial semantics rather than Python's natural semantics. This creates the illusion of the DSL's code running seamlessly within Python. I think of these as \"artificial decorators\"; hence, among friends I call them **\"Art-Deco DSLs.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern is _very_ powerful. It lets us build arbitrarily complex DSLs on top of Python's rich syntax, borrowing as much or as little of Python's existing semantics as we wish. For example, I will show you how to build a simple toy DSL called \"env\" which augments Python such that all-caps variable names get automatically looked up in the shell's environment (as in shell scripts).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@env\n",
    "def whoami():\n",
    "    return \"You are: \" + USER\n",
    "print(whoami())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The env DSL is very simple and just extends Python's scoping behavior while preserving the rest of the semantics as-is. Other DSLs might rewrite the semantics entirely. For example, we could build an Art-Deco implementation of Conway's [FRACTRAN language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FRACTRAN#). Here, a sequence of Python integer literals and division operators gets interpreted _as if_ it were FRACTRAN code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@fractran\n",
    "def multiply(a, b):\n",
    "    455/33\n",
    "    11/13\n",
    "    1/11\n",
    "    3/7\n",
    "    11/2\n",
    "    1/3\n",
    "print(multiply(3, 4))  # 12\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we might creatively reinterpret Python's syntax to provide a convenient Graphviz-like syntax for defining graphs. This language doesn't really have _any_ runtime semantics to speak of: it's just syntactic sugar to describe data in a convenient format.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@digraph\n",
    "def G():\n",
    "    a >> b >> c\n",
    "    a >> c (linestyle=dashed)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I think the Art-Deco pattern is really worth knowing, and so for future DSL designers I've compiled some notes on how to build DSLs this way. Most of this is straightforward, and I would expect that from this description alone a proficient Python programmer could come up with the rest of this guide on their own by consulting the Python documentation. But there are some tricky bits here and there to watch out for, and I think there is value in collecting everything all in one page…"

    "The return value of a decorator replaces definition it decorates. Hence, if a decorator itself returns a function, it creates the illusion of replacing that function with a modified version of itself. For example, here is a decorator `@diff` that replaces the given function `f` with an approximation of its derivative `df`. To do this, the decorator defines a new function `df`, which internally calls the original `f` at `x` and `x + dx` to compute a finite-difference estimate of the derivative. Then the decorator returns `df`, which means `f` is replaced with `df`. Notice that `df` is a totally different function from `f` — it even has a different signature! They just happen to be related in the sense that `df` calls `f` twice to compute the finite difference. In general, a decorator can return an arbitrary function (or even an object that isn't a function at all)."

    "In this guide I summarized the key ideas behind building Art-Deco DSLs. I showed you how to work with decorators, how to parse input Python code (being careful about source location), and how to run generated Python code (being careful about scope). I hope you find these tools useful as you go about building your own Art-Deco DSLs!"
